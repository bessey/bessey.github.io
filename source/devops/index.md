# Dev Ops

As well as [web development](/webdev.html) I am firmly familiar with systems administration. Since I first started developing in 2009, I've managed the servers that the sites I've created were hosted on.

As such I am familiar with general UNIX administration, Amazon EC2, Linode, Heroku, and more. I have worked with deployment tools such as Capistrano, as well as the version control systems Git and SVN.

I have set up many other services, some to learn, some out of need. As of writing the list stands at: Nginx, Passenger, Redis, Resque, Sidekiq, MySQL, Apache Solr, Varnish, and Squid.
