# Web Development
I am primarily a Ruby on Rails developer, working with HTML5, CSS3, JS. Other languages and frameworks I am familiar with include *Django, jQuery, MySQL, PHP, Sass, and Markdown*. I also have extensive knowledge of languages not traditionally associated with web thanks to my degree.

I focus on development over design, though I'm no stranger to it. If you'd like to discuss freelance work, please [throw me an email](mailto:bessey@gmail.com) or [message me on LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/mattbessey).

Here's some of the projects I have worked on in my career.

# MattBessey
*This* site is built on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and written in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). With a bit of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to ease the pain. You can read the source code for the site on [GitHub](https://github.com/bessey/MattBessey.com). It's hosted on Heroku.

# SNGTRKR
[SNGTRKR (Song Tracker)](http://sngtrkr.com) is a website founded by myself and a friend of mine to help ourselves and others keep up with new music releases. We found while there are services to discover artists that you'd never heard of before, there were few inspiring services to discover new music by artists you already follow.

I built the backend of SNGTRKR from the ground up. We started the project in PHP but quickly realised it was slowing progress significantly, and decided to use it as an opportunity to learn Rails. Boy am I glad we did!

# Bardowl
[Bardowl](//bardowl.com) provide an audiobook streaming service via an iPhone app. I helped create a system to analyse server log data and serve it to an administrator in an attractive manner.

On this project I made heavy use of Twitter Bootstrap, as the site is completely internal to the company, functionality was the most important point. Bootstrap enabled me to hit the ground running and have the front end very polished in a matter of hours.
